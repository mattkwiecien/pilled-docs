# Privacy Policy for Pilled

**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

## Overview

Pilled ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO data.**

The App does not:
- Collect any personal information
- Require user accounts or registration
- Track your usage or behavior
- Send your data to any servers
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Share your information with third parties

## Data Storage

All medication information and dose logs you create in the App are stored **locally on your device only** using Apple's SwiftData framework. Your data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not backed up to our servers (we don't have any)
- Is not accessible to the App developer
- Remains under your complete control

## iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your medication data may be included in your encrypted iCloud backup, managed entirely by Apple. We have no access to your iCloud data.

## System Features

The App uses Apple's notification system to notify you when recurring medications are automatically logged (Premium feature only). These notifications:

- Are generated locally on your device
- Do not send any data to external servers
- Require your permission to be enabled
- Can be disabled in iOS Settings at any time

No data is collected or transmitted through the notification system.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time:

1. **Delete History:** Settings → Data → Delete History
2. **Delete Everything:** Settings → Data → Delete Everything
3. **Uninstall the App:** Removes all local data permanently

## Third-Party Services

The App contains external links that open in Safari:
- **Buy Me a Coffee** (https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mattapril) - Support link in Settings
- **Documentation & Legal Pages** (https://matt-april.github.io/pilled-docs/) - Links to this privacy policy, medical disclaimer, and documentation hosted on GitHub Pages

These links open in your device's Safari browser and are subject to their respective privacy policies (Buy Me a Coffee's privacy policy and GitHub's privacy policy). No data is transmitted from the app to these services.

No third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools are integrated into the app.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children. Because we collect no data at all, the App is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new policy here and update the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data:
- There is no data to request
- There is no data to delete from our servers
- There is no data to export from us (though you can export your local data as CSV)
